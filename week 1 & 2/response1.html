What did I learn from this article?
    I feel like I had a basic understanding of code and how it worked and what it was, but I learned a lot of the history behind each one and why we cycle through the different languages. 
    It was also interesting to see how different languages looked. I have heard of C, C++, Javascript, Python, PHP, Ruby, but I've only coded in a couple of them. I had never seen fortran, and I'm glad we have abandoned it. It also taught me about what object-oriented languages were. 

Thoughts on the article:
The article is entertaining, and the interactive parts appeal to my neanderthal-like artist's brain ("Ooh! Colors! Ah, shapes!"). But I feel like it tries to tackle on too much. It become rather unorganized and some parts of it seem to belong as another topic entirely.
